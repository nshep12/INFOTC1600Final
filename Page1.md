### How to write your first program

Hello and welcome to my tutorial on how to write your first program using Python!
Listed below are bite-sized instructions on how to go about getting a basic development environment set up and producing your first lines of code. Good luck and enjoy!

1. To get started we need to download the latest version of Python for your computer [from Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads).
2. Once Python is installed, press the Window's key or CMD to search for and open "IDLE" on your computer.
3. We're now ready to tell the world Hello with a simple statement input on IDLE. Type the following: ```print("Hello World!")```
4. Next we need to save our program so we can execute it whenever we would like. Save the file somewhere on your computer and simply double click the file to execute it.
5. $$$$$ profit! You have written and executed your first program!
